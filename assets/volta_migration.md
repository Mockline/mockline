# Change of Ticketing Tool

We are transitioning from Linear to Volta for ticket management.

## Why this change?

### We have chosen to change tools for several reasons:
- Linear's pricing model restricts access to essential features, while Volta offers core functionality without cost barriers
- As an open-source project ourselves, Volta's open-source philosophy and GitHub-centric approach aligns with our values
- Volta provides seamless GitHub integration, allowing direct issue creation and management from either platform
- Enhanced collaboration features with built-in repository tracking and issue management in one unified interface

## Key Benefits of Volta:
- Native GitHub integration for streamlined workflow
- Simplified issue tracking across repositories
- Open-source friendly environment
- Direct repository synchronization
- Unified platform for both private and open-source projects

## How will this transition take place?

We have migrated all issues from Linear to Volta. Therefore, you can find all the issues you created on Linear now on Volta.

## How to access Volta?

You can access Volta by clicking on the following link: [Volta](https://volta.net/Mockline/mockline)

## How to create an issue?
