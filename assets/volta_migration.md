# Change of Ticketing Tool

We are transitioning from Linear to Volta for ticket management.

## Why this change?

### We have chosen to change tools for several reasons:
-  Linear required us to pay for basic features.
-  We are an open-source tool, and Volta aligns with this philosophy.
-  Our issues will be linked to Volta.

## How will this transition take place?

We have migrated all issues from Linear to Volta. Therefore, you can find all the issues you created on Linear now on Volta.

## How to access Volta?

You can access Volta by clicking on the following link: [Volta](https://volta.net/Mockline/mockline)

## How to create an issue?

To create an issue, simply click on the "New Issue" button at the top right of the page.
