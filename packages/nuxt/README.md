```
It will automatically install and set up the Mockline module in your `nuxt.config.ts` file.

or

1. Add `mockline` dependency to your project

```bash
# Using bun
bun install -D mockline

# Using pnpm
pnpm add -D mockline

# Using yarn
yarn add --dev mockline

# Using npm
npm install --save-dev mockline
```

2. Add `mockline` to the `modules` section of `nuxt.config.ts`

```js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    'mockline'
  ]
})
```

That's it! You can now use Mockline in your Nuxt app âœ¨
