## Reka UI

We use [Reka UI](https://reka-ui.com/) as our core component foundation. This shift brings several key advantages:

- **Extensive Component Library**: With 55+ primitives, Reka UI significantly expands our component offerings.
- **Active Development**: Reka UI's growing popularity ensures ongoing improvements and updates.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features align with our commitment to inclusive design.
- **Vue 3 Optimization**: Seamless integration with Vue 3 and the Composition API.

This transition empowers Nuxt UI to become a more comprehensive and flexible UI library, offering developers greater power and customization options.

## Tailwind CSS v4

Mockline integrates the latest Tailwind CSS v4, bringing significant improvements:

- **Built for performance**: Full builds in the new engine are up to 5x faster, and incremental builds are over 100x faster â€” and measured in microseconds.
- **Unified toolchain**: Built-in import handling, vendor prefixing, and syntax transforms, with no additional tooling required.
- **CSS-first configuration**: A reimagined developer experience where you customize and extend the framework directly in CSS instead of a JavaScript configuration file.
- **Designed for the modern web**: Built on native cascade layers, wide-gamut colors, and including first-class support for modern CSS features like container queries, @starting-style, popovers, and more.

This integration unifies the styling of components, ensuring consistency and code maintainability.

  - Improved type inference for slots and events
